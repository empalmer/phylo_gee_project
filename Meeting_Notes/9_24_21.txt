Make correlation matrix more biologically meaningful
using more of the structure of the tree
use phylogenetic tree

Coefficient fixed.
make more flexible - time varying coefficients.

compositionality in regresison setting.

find log ratio paper

Availability of data:

Is correlation matri positive semidefinite

look up what a corenec product is? how semidefinite things multiply together.


Constrain gamma matrix to be postive semidefinite -
base on a distance
Do GEES require positive semidefinite?


****Look at laplace matrix?
for use as a distance matrix as the correlation?


send log-ratio

look up compositional + longitudinal


TODO
look up time varying coefficients
look up reduced rank regression
send Yuan
   - my internship work

Directions:
Omics data integration
Longitudinal microbiome data

constraint on observations vs means
