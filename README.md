The repository for my first PhD project: 

Work during Fall 2021 at Oregon State University under the supervision of Dr. Yuan Jiang. 

My work is focused on methods for microbiome data analysis. Current work is on moddeling microbial abundance in 16S data using Generalized Estimating Equations and specifying a correlation structure based on the phylogeny the microbes belong to in addition to compositional structure with Dirichlet correlation ideas.
